                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I come from a Mexican background, my family moved here to the United States when I was
                    about two or three years old. I rememeber that from a young age I loved computers and how they
                    worked,
                    I loved watching TV and the FBI agents screen was filled with coding and them just typing away, even
                    though I know
                    it's not like that in real life, it was still so intersting. But after the years went on I left that
                    idea behind. It wasn't until
                    a friend of mine introduced me back to computers and my interest for computers came back.</p>

                <h3>MY WORK</h3>
                <p>The only work that I have done recently is work that I get assigned to in class which have been a
                    great way to
                    get me started on how to play with different things and see what really goes on behind the website.
                    I will attach an image
                    below so you can see more or less what I've been working with and learning. </p>
