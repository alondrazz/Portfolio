            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I come from a Mexican background, my family moved here to the United States when I was
                about two or three years old. I rememeber that from a young age I loved computers and how they worked,
                I loved watching TV and the FBI agents screen was filled with coding and them just typing away, even
                though I know
                it's not like that in real life, it was still so intersting. But after the years went on I left that
                idea behind. It wasn't until
                a friend of mine introduced me back to computers and my interest for computers came back.</p>

        <h3>MY WORK</h3>
        <p>I currently have no work besides this one. This will be my first website that I make from scratch and
            I can't wait to look back to this in a couple months or even years and see how far I've come.</p>
